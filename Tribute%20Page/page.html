            </blockquote><b>Hayao Miyazaki</b> (宮崎 駿, born January 5, 1941) is a Japanese film director, producer, screenwriter, animator, author, and manga artist. Through a career that has spanned five decades, Miyazaki has attained international acclaim as a masterful
            storyteller and as a maker of anime feature films and, along with Isao Takahata, co-founded Studio Ghibli, a film and animation studio. Miyazaki has been described as combining elements of Walt Disney, Steven Spielberg and Orson Welles.
            <br>
            <br> Miyazaki's films often contain recurrent themes, like humanity's relationship with nature and technology, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic. His films's protagonists are often strong girls or young women. While two of his
            films, The Castle of Cagliostro and Castle in the Sky, involve traditional villains, his other films like Nausicaä and Princess Mononoke present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. In 2002, American film critic Roger Ebert
            suggested that Miyazaki may be the best animation filmmaker in history, praising the depth and artistry of his films. In November 2014, Miyazaki was awarded an Honorary Academy Award for his impact on animation and cinema. He is the second
            Japanese filmmaker to win this award, after Akira Kurosawa in 1990.
            <br>
            <br> His most famous films include:

            <blockquote>
                In this 17-minute video essay, Lewis Bond takes us through Miyazaki's genius and how he excels at bringing three-dimensional characters to his two-dimensional films. "His aim wasn’t to make films that spoke down to children. His aim was to make films
                that would help us all understand the human condition,” Bond says.
